Submissions for interview challenges  


### 1) Hysteresis Challenge  
Given the function prototype:  
unsigned int hysteresis(unsigned int input_percent)  

Create code to perform hysteresis for the specified ranges and outputs:  
{10,15} => 0 transitions to 1  
{35,40} => 1 transitions to 2  
{60,65} => 2 transitions to 3  
{85,90} => 3 transitions to 4  

My submission can be viewed in hysteresis.c
